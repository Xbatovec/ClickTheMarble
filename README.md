# ClickTheMarble
Smaller project about the marble that bounces off the walls and your goal is to click the marble as many times as possible. I used JS, HTML, CSS.

## How to start
* Choose x & y position (the maximum position is depending on the resolution of your monitor) If you set position larger than your resolution marble so the marble will be placed on the edge of the window.
* choose direction (direction is defined in grades)
* choose speed (0.3-10)

## How to play
* It's easy. Just click on the marble.

## How the score works
* The score is directly dependent on the speed of the marble.
* It is also important to note that scores are stored using cookies.

### How the score counting works
* If you set the speed less than 1, the score is calculated according to the equation: (speed * 10)
* If you set the speed higher than 1, the score is calculated according to the equation: (speed * 250)
